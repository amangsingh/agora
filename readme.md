# Agora (Agentic Go Runtime Architecture)

An agentic framework for Go, built from first principles.

## Overview

Agora is a modular agentic framework for Go, inspired by LangGraph but designed specifically for the Go ecosystem. Built with elegance and modularity at its core, Agora enables developers to construct sophisticated agent-based systems with the performance, concurrency, and type safety that Go provides.

## Philosophy

- **First Principles**: Clean architecture built from the ground up for Go
- **Utterly Modular**: Compose agents and workflows with maximum flexibility
- **Local-First**: Initial support prioritizes local model deployment
- **Go Native**: Leverage Go's strengths—concurrency, performance, and simplicity

## Status

🚧 **Early Development** - Agora is in active development. APIs and interfaces are subject to change.

## Roadmap

- [x] Project initialization
- [ ] Core graph abstractions
- [ ] State management
- [ ] Local model integrations (Ollama, LocalAI, etc.)
- [ ] Agent primitives and tools
- [ ] Workflow orchestration
- [ ] Cloud model support
- [ ] Documentation and examples

## Why Go?

Go's concurrency model, static typing, and performance characteristics make it ideal for building production-grade agentic systems. Agora brings the power of graph-based agent orchestration to the Go ecosystem.
